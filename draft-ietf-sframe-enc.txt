                      draft-ietf-sframe-enc-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the Secure Frame (SFrame) end-to-end
   encryption and authentication mechanism for media frames in a
   multiparty conference call, in which central media servers (selective
   forwarding units or SFUs) can access the media metadata needed to
   make forwarding decisions without having access to the actual media.

   The proposed mechanism differs from the Secure Real-Time Protocol
   (SRTP) in that it is independent of RTP (thus compatible with non-RTP
   media transport) and can be applied to whole media frames in order to
   be more bandwidth efficient.

1.  Introduction

   Modern multi-party video call systems use Selective Forwarding Unit
   (SFU) servers to efficiently route media streams to call endpoints
   based on factors such as available bandwidth, desired video size,
   codec support, and other factors.  An SFU typically does not need
   access to the media content of the conference, allowing for the media
   to be "end-to-end" encrypted so that it cannot be decrypted by the
   SFU.  In order for the SFU to work properly, though, it usually needs
   to be able to access RTP metadata and RTCP feedback messages, which
   is not possible if all RTP/RTCP traffic is end-to-end encrypted.

   As such, two layers of encryption and authentication are required:

   1.  Hop-by-hop (HBH) encryption of media, metadata, and feedback
       messages between the the endpoints and SFU

   2.  End-to-end (E2E) encryption (E2EE) of media between the endpoints

   The Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP) is already widely used for HBH
   encryption [RFC3711].  The SRTP "double encryption" scheme defines a
   way to do E2E encryption in SRTP [RFC8723].  Unfortunately, this
   scheme has poor efficiency and high complexity, and its entanglement
   with RTP makes it unworkable in several realistic SFU scenarios.

   This document proposes a new E2EE protection scheme known as SFrame,
   specifically designed to work in group conference calls with SFUs.
   SFrame is a general encryption framing that can be used to protect
   media payloads, agnostic of transport.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   MAC:  Message Authentication Code

   E2EE:  End to End Encryption

   HBH:  Hop By Hop

   We use "Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)" and "media stream" in a less
   formal sense than in [RFC7656].  An SFU is a selective switching
   function for media payloads, and a media stream a sequence of media
   payloads, in both cases regardless of whether those media payloads
   are transported over RTP or some other protocol.

3.  Goals

   SFrame is designed to be a suitable E2EE protection scheme for
   conference call media in a broad range of scenarios, as outlined by
   the following goals:

   1.  Provide a secure E2EE mechanism for audio and video in conference
       calls that can be used with arbitrary SFU servers.

   2.  Decouple media encryption from key management to allow SFrame to
       be used with an arbitrary key management system.

   3.  Minimize packet expansion to allow successful conferencing in as
       many network conditions as possible.

   4.  Independence from the underlying transport, including use in non-
       RTP transports, e.g., WebTransport [I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview].

   5.  When used with RTP and its associated error resilience
       mechanisms, i.e., RTX and FEC, require no special handling for
       RTX and FEC packets.

   6.  Minimize the changes needed in SFU servers.

   7.  Minimize the changes needed in endpoints.

   8.  Work with the most popular audio and video codecs used in
       conferencing scenarios.

4.  SFrame

   This document defines an encryption mechanism that provides effective
   E2EE, is simple to implement, has no dependencies on RTP, and
   minimizes encryption bandwidth overhead.  This section describes how
   the mechanism works, including details of how applications utilize
   SFrame for media protection, as well as the actual mechanics of E2EE
   for protecting media.

4.1.  Application Context

   SFrame is a general encryption framing, intended to be used as an
   E2EE layer over an underlying HBH-encrypted transport such as SRTP or
   QUIC [RFC3711][I-D.ietf-moq-transport].

   The scale at which SFrame encryption is applied to media determines
   the overall amount of overhead that SFrame adds to the media stream,
   as well as the engineering complexity involved in integrating SFrame
   into a particular environment.  Two patterns are common: Either using
   SFrame to encrypt whole media frames (per-frame) or individual
   transport-level media payloads (per-packet).

   For example, Figure 1 shows a typical media sender stack that takes
   media from some source, encodes it into frames, divides those frames
   into media packets, and then sends those payloads in SRTP packets.
   The receiver stack performs the reverse operations, reassembling
   frames from SRTP packets and decoding.  Arrows indicate two different
   ways that SFrame protection could be integrated into this media
   stack, to encrypt whole frames or individual media packets.

   Applying SFrame per-frame in this system offers higher efficiency,
   but may require a more complex integration in environments where
   depacketization relies on the content of media packets.  Applying
   SFrame per-packet avoids this complexity, at the cost of higher
   bandwidth consumption.  Some quantitative discussion of these trade-
   offs is provided in Appendix C.

   As noted above, however, SFrame is a general media encapsulation, and
   can be applied in other scenarios.  The important thing is that the
   sender and receivers of an SFrame-encrypted object agree on that
   object's semantics.  SFrame does not provide this agreement; it must
   be arranged by the application.

                               Figure 1

   Like SRTP, SFrame does not define how the keys used for SFrame are
   exchanged by the parties in the conference.  Keys for SFrame might be
   distributed over an existing E2E-secure channel (see Section 5.1), or
   derived from an E2E-secure shared secret (see Section 5.2).  The key
   management system MUST ensure that each key used for encrypting media
   is used by exactly one media sender, in order to avoid reuse of
   nonces.

4.2.  SFrame Ciphertext

   An SFrame ciphertext comprises an SFrame header followed by the
   output of an AEAD encryption of the plaintext [RFC5116], with the
   header provided as additional authenticated data (AAD).

   The SFrame header is a variable-length structure described in detail
   in Section 4.3.  The structure of the encrypted data and
   authentication tag are determined by the AEAD algorithm in use.

   |                                                             |
   +--- Encrypted Portion               Authenticated Portion ---+

   When SFrame is applied per-packet, the payload of each packet will be
   an SFrame ciphertext.  When SFrame is applied per-frame, the SFrame
   ciphertext representing an encrypted frame will span several packets,
   with the header appearing in the first packet and the authentication
   tag in the last packet.  It is the responsibility of the application
   to reassemble an encrypted frame from individual packets, accounting
   for packet loss and reordering as necessary.

4.3.  SFrame Header

   The SFrame header specifies two values from which encryption
   parameters are derived:

   *  A Key ID (KID) that determines which encryption key should be used

   *  A counter (CTR) that is used to construct the nonce for the
      encryption

   Applications MUST ensure that each (KID, CTR) combination is used for
   exactly one SFrame encryption operation.  A typical approach to
   achieving this guarantee is outlined in Section 9.1.

      Config Byte
           |
    .-----' '-----.
   |               |
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+------------+------------+
   |X|  K  |Y|  C  |   KID...   |   CTR...   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+------------+------------+

                          Figure 2: SFrame header

   The SFrame Header has the overall structure shown in Figure 2.  The
   first byte is a "config byte", with the following fields:

   Extended Key Id Flag (X, 1 bit):  Indicates if the K field contains
      the key id or the Key ID length.

   Key or Key Length (K, 3 bits):  If the X flag is set to 0, this field
      contains the Key ID.  If the X flag is set to 1, then it contains
      the length of the Key ID, minus one.

   Extended Counter Flag (Y, 1 bit):  Indicates if the C field contains
      the counter or the counter length.

   Counter or Counter Length (C, 3 bits):  This field contains the
      counter (CTR) if the Y flag is set to 0, or the counter length,
      minus one, if set to 1.

   The Key ID and Counter fields are encoded as compact unsigned
   integers in network (big-endian) byte order.  If the value of one of
   these fields is in the range 0-7, then the value is carried in the
   corresponding bits of the config byte (K or C) and the corresponding
   flag (X or Y) is set to zero.  Otherwise, the value MUST be encoded
   with the minimum number of bytes required and appended after the
   configuration byte, with the Key ID first and Counter second.  The
   header field (K or C) is set to the number of bytes in the encoded
   value, minus one.  The value 000 represents a length of 1, 001 a
   length of 2, etc.  This allows a 3-bit length field to represent the
   value lengths 1-8.

   The SFrame header can thus take one of the four forms shown in
   Figure 3, depending on which of the X and Y flags are set.

   KID < 8, CTR < 8:
   +-+-----+-+-----+
   |0| KID |0| CTR |
   +-+-----+-+-----+

   KID < 8, CTR >= 8:
   +-+-----+-+-----+------------------------+
   |0| KID |1|CLEN |  CTR... (length=CLEN)  |
   +-+-----+-+-----+------------------------+

   KID >= 8, CTR < 8:
   +-+-----+-+-----+------------------------+
   |1|KLEN |0| CTR |  KID... (length=KLEN)  |
   +-+-----+-+-----+------------------------+

   KID >= 8, CTR >= 8:
   +-+-----+-+-----+------------------------+------------------------+
   |1|KLEN |1|CLEN |  KID... (length=KLEN)  |  CTR... (length=CLEN)  |
   +-+-----+-+-----+------------------------+------------------------+

4.4.  Encryption Schema

   SFrame encryption uses an AEAD encryption algorithm and hash function
   defined by the cipher suite in use (see Section 4.5).  We will refer
   to the following aspects of the AEAD and the hash algorithm below:

   *  AEAD.Encrypt and AEAD.Decrypt - The encryption and decryption
      functions for the AEAD.  We follow the convention of RFC 5116
      [RFC5116] and consider the authentication tag part of the
      ciphertext produced by AEAD.Encrypt (as opposed to a separate
      field as in SRTP [RFC3711]).

   *  AEAD.Nk - The size in bytes of a key for the encryption algorithm

   *  AEAD.Nn - The size in bytes of a nonce for the encryption
      algorithm

   *  AEAD.Nt - The overhead in bytes of the encryption algorithm
      (typically the size of a "tag" that is added to the plaintext)

   *  AEAD.Nka - For cipher suites using the compound AEAD described in
      Section 4.5.1, the size in bytes of a key for the underlying AES-
      CTR algorithm

   *  Hash.Nh - The size in bytes of the output of the hash function

4.4.1.  Key Selection

   Each SFrame encryption or decryption operation is premised on a
   single secret base_key, which is labeled with an integer KID value
   signaled in the SFrame header.

   The sender and receivers need to agree on which base_key should be
   used for a given KID.  Moreover, senders and receivers need to agree
   on whether a base_key will be used for encryption or decryption only.
   The process for provisioning base_key values and their KID values is
   beyond the scope of this specification, but its security properties
   will bound the assurances that SFrame provides.  For example, if
   SFrame is used to provide E2E security against intermediary media
   nodes, then SFrame keys need to be negotiated in a way that does not
   make them accessible to these intermediaries.

   For each known KID value, the client stores the corresponding
   symmetric key base_key.  For keys that can be used for encryption,
   the client also stores the next counter value CTR to be used when
   encrypting (initially 0).

   When encrypting a plaintext, the application specifies which KID is
   to be used, and the counter is incremented after successful
   encryption.  When decrypting, the base_key for decryption is selected
   from the available keys using the KID value in the SFrame Header.

   A given base_key MUST NOT be used for encryption by multiple senders.
   Such reuse would result in multiple encrypted frames being generated
   with the same (key, nonce) pair, which harms the protections provided
   by many AEAD algorithms.  Implementations MUST mark each base_key as
   usable for encryption or decryption, never both.

   Note that the set of available keys might change over the lifetime of
   a real-time session.  In such cases, the client will need to manage
   key usage to avoid media loss due to a key being used to encrypt
   before all receivers are able to use it to decrypt.  For example, an
   application may make decryption-only keys available immediately, but
   delay the use of keys for encryption until (a) all receivers have
   acknowledged receipt of the new key or (b) a timeout expires.

4.4.2.  Key Derivation

   SFrame encryption and decryption use a key and salt derived from the
   base_key associated to a KID.  Given a base_key value, the key and
   salt are derived using HKDF [RFC5869] as follows:

   def derive_key_salt(KID, base_key):
     sframe_secret = HKDF-Extract("", base_key)

     sframe_key_label = "SFrame 1.0 Secret key " + KID + cipher_suite
     sframe_key = HKDF-Expand(sframe_secret, info, AEAD.Nk)

     sframe_salt_label = "SFrame 1.0 Secret salt " + KID + cipher_suite
     sframe_salt = HKDF-Expand(sframe_secret, info, AEAD.Nn)

     return sframe_key, sframe_salt

   In the derivation of sframe_secret:

   *  The + operator represents concatenation of byte strings.

   *  The KID value is encoded as an 8-byte big-endian integer, not the
      compressed form used in the SFrame header.

   *  The cipher_suite value is a 2-byte big-endian integer representing
      the cipher suite in use (see Section 8.1).

   The hash function used for HKDF is determined by the cipher suite in
   use.

4.4.3.  Encryption

   SFrame encryption uses the AEAD encryption algorithm for the cipher
   suite in use.  The key for the encryption is the sframe_key and the
   nonce is formed by XORing the sframe_salt with the current counter,
   encoded as a big-endian integer of length AEAD.Nn.

   The encryptor forms an SFrame header using the CTR, and KID values
   provided.  The encoded header is provided as AAD to the AEAD
   encryption operation, together with application-provided metadata
   about the encrypted media (see Section 9.4).

def encrypt(CTR, KID, metadata, plaintext):
  sframe_key, sframe_salt = key_store[KID]

  # encode_big_endian(x, n) produces an n-byte string encoding the integer x in
  # big-endian byte order.
  ctr = encode_big_endian(CTR, AEAD.Nn)
  nonce = xor(sframe_salt, CTR)

  # encode_sframe_header produces a byte string encoding the provided KID and
  # CTR values into an SFrame Header.
  header = encode_sframe_header(CTR, KID)
  aad = header + metadata

  ciphertext = AEAD.Encrypt(sframe_key, nonce, aad, plaintext)
  return header + ciphertext

   For example, the metadata input to encryption allows for frame
   metadata to be authenticated when SFrame is applied per-frame.  After
   encoding the frame and before packetizing it, the necessary media
   metadata will be moved out of the encoded frame buffer, to be sent in
   some channel visible to the SFU (e.g., an RTP header extension).

4.4.4.  Decryption

   Before decrypting, a receiver needs to assemble a full SFrame
   ciphertext.  When an SFrame ciphertext may be fragmented into
   multiple parts for transport (e.g., a whole encrypted frame sent in
   multiple SRTP packets), the receiving client collects all the
   fragments of the ciphertext, using an appropriate sequencing and
   start/end markers in the transport.  Once all of the required
   fragments are available, the client reassembles them into the SFrame
   ciphertext, then passes the ciphertext to SFrame for decryption.

   The KID field in the SFrame header is used to find the right key and
   salt for the encrypted frame, and the CTR field is used to construct
   the nonce.  The SFrame decryption procedure is as follows:

   def decrypt(metadata, sframe_ciphertext):
     KID, CTR, header, ciphertext = parse_ciphertext(sframe_ciphertext)

     sframe_key, sframe_salt = key_store[KID]

     ctr = encode_big_endian(CTR, AEAD.Nn)
     nonce = xor(sframe_salt, ctr)
     aad = header + metadata

     return AEAD.Decrypt(sframe_key, nonce, aad, ciphertext)

   If a ciphertext fails to decrypt because there is no key available
   for the KID in the SFrame header, the client MAY buffer the
   ciphertext and retry decryption once a key with that KID is received.
   If a ciphertext fails to decrypt for any other reason, the client
   MUST discard the ciphertext.  Invalid ciphertexts SHOULD be discarded
   in a way that is indistinguishable (to an external observer) from
   having processed a valid ciphertext.  In other words, the SFrame
   decrypt operation should be constant-time, regardless of whether
   decryption succeeds or fails.

4.5.  Cipher Suites

   Each SFrame session uses a single cipher suite that specifies the
   following primitives:

   *  A hash function used for key derivation

   *  An AEAD encryption algorithm [RFC5116] used for frame encryption,
      optionally with a truncated authentication tag

   This document defines the following cipher suites, with the constants
   defined in Section 4.4:

         +============================+====+=====+====+====+====+
         | Name                       | Nh | Nka | Nk | Nn | Nt |
         +============================+====+=====+====+====+====+

         +----------------------------+----+-----+----+----+----+
         | AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_64 | 32 | 16  | 48 | 12 | 8  |
         +----------------------------+----+-----+----+----+----+
         | AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_32 | 32 | 16  | 48 | 12 | 4  |
         +----------------------------+----+-----+----+----+----+
         | AES_128_GCM_SHA256_128     | 32 | n/a | 16 | 12 | 16 |
         +----------------------------+----+-----+----+----+----+
         | AES_256_GCM_SHA512_128     | 64 | n/a | 32 | 12 | 16 |
         +----------------------------+----+-----+----+----+----+

                  Table 1: SFrame cipher suite constants

   Numeric identifiers for these cipher suites are defined in the IANA
   registry created in Section 8.1.

   In the suite names, the length of the authentication tag is indicated
   by the last value: "_128" indicates a hundred-twenty-eight-bit tag,
   "_80" indicates a eighty-bit tag, "_64" indicates a sixty-four-bit
   tag and "_32" indicates a thirty-two-bit tag.

   In a session that uses multiple media streams, different cipher
   suites might be configured for different media streams.  For example,
   in order to conserve bandwidth, a session might use a cipher suite
   with eighty-bit tags for video frames and another cipher suite with
   thirty-two-bit tags for audio frames.

4.5.1.  AES-CTR with SHA2

   In order to allow very short tag sizes, we define a synthetic AEAD
   function using the authenticated counter mode of AES together with
   HMAC for authentication.  We use an encrypt-then-MAC approach, as in
   SRTP [RFC3711].

   Before encryption or decryption, encryption and authentication
   subkeys are derived from the single AEAD key.  The overall length of
   the AEAD key is Nka + Nh, where Nka represents the key size for the
   AES block cipher in use and Nh represents the output size of the hash
   function (as in Table 2).  The encryption subkey comprises the first
   Nka bytes and the authentication subkey comprises the remaining Nh
   bytes.

   def derive_subkeys(sframe_key):
     enc_key = sframe_key[..Nka]
     auth_key = sframe_key[Nka..]
     return enc_key, auth_key

   The AEAD encryption and decryption functions are then composed of
   individual calls to the CTR encrypt function and HMAC.  The resulting
   MAC value is truncated to a number of bytes Nt fixed by the cipher
   suite.

   def truncate(tag, n):
     # Take the first `n` bytes of `tag`
     return tag[..n]

   def compute_tag(auth_key, nonce, aad, ct):
     aad_len = encode_big_endian(len(aad), 8)
     ct_len = encode_big_endian(len(ct), 8)
     tag_len = encode_big_endian(Nt, 8)
     auth_data = aad_len + ct_len + tag_len + nonce + aad + ct
     tag = HMAC(auth_key, auth_data)
     return truncate(tag, Nt)

   def AEAD.Encrypt(key, nonce, aad, pt):
     enc_key, auth_key = derive_subkeys(key)
     initial_counter = nonce + 0x00000000 # append four zero bytes
     ct = AES-CTR.Encrypt(enc_key, initial_counter, pt)
     tag = compute_tag(auth_key, nonce, aad, ct)
     return ct + tag

   def AEAD.Decrypt(key, nonce, aad, ct):
     inner_ct, tag = split_ct(ct, tag_len)

     enc_key, auth_key = derive_subkeys(key)
     candidate_tag = compute_tag(auth_key, nonce, aad, inner_ct)
     if !constant_time_equal(tag, candidate_tag):
       raise Exception("Authentication Failure")

     initial_counter = nonce + 0x00000000 # append four zero bytes
     return AES-CTR.Decrypt(enc_key, initial_counter, inner_ct)

5.  Key Management

   SFrame must be integrated with an E2E key management framework to
   exchange and rotate the keys used for SFrame encryption.  The key
   management framework provides the following functions:

   *  Provisioning KID / base_key mappings to participating clients

   *  Updating the above data as clients join or leave

   It is the responsibility of the application to provide the key
   management framework, as described in Section 9.2.

5.1.  Sender Keys

   If the participants in a call have a pre-existing E2E-secure channel,
   they can use it to distribute SFrame keys.  Each client participating
   in a call generates a fresh base_key value that it will use to
   encrypt media.  The client then uses the E2E-secure channel to send
   their encryption key to the other participants.

   In this scheme, it is assumed that receivers have a signal outside of
   SFrame for which client has sent a given frame (e.g., an RTP SSRC).
   SFrame KID values are then used to distinguish between versions of
   the sender's base_key.

   Key IDs in this scheme have two parts, a "key generation" and a
   "ratchet step".  Both are unsigned integers that begin at zero.  The
   key generation increments each time the sender distributes a new key
   to receivers.  The "ratchet step" is incremented each time the sender
   ratchets their key forward for forward secrecy:

   base_key[i+1] = HKDF-Expand(
                     HKDF-Extract("", base_key[i]),
                     "SFrame 1.0 Ratchet", CipherSuite.Nh)

   For compactness, we do not send the whole ratchet step.  Instead, we
   send only its low-order R bits, where R is a value set by the
   application.  Different senders may use different values of R, but
   each receiver of a given sender needs to know what value of R is used
   by the sender so that they can recognize when they need to ratchet
   (vs. expecting a new key).  R effectively defines a re-ordering
   window, since no more than 2^R ratchet steps can be active at a given
   time.  The key generation is sent in the remaining 64 - R bits of the
   key ID.

   KID = (key_generation << R) + (ratchet_step % (1 << R))

        64-R bits         R bits
    <---------------> <------------>
   +-----------------+--------------+
   | Key Generation  | Ratchet Step |
   +-----------------+--------------+

           Figure 6: Structure of a KID in the Sender Keys scheme

   The sender signals such a ratchet step update by sending with a KID
   value in which the ratchet step has been incremented.  A receiver who
   receives from a sender with a new KID computes the new key as above.
   The old key may be kept for some time to allow for out-of-order
   delivery, but should be deleted promptly.

   If a new participant joins in the middle of a session, they will need
   to receive from each sender (a) the current sender key for that
   sender and (b) the current KID value for the sender.  Evicting a
   participant requires each sender to send a fresh sender key to all
   receivers.

   It is up to the application to decide when sender keys are updated.
   A sender key may be updated by sending a new base_key (updating the
   key generation) or by hashing the current base_key (updating the
   ratchet step).  Ratcheting the key forward is useful when adding new
   receivers to an SFrame-based interaction, since it assures that the
   new receivers can't decrypt any media encrypted before they were
   added.  If a sender wishes to assure the opposite property when
   removing a receiver (i.e., ensuring that the receiver can't decrypt
   media after they are removed), then the sender will need to
   distribute a new sender key.

5.2.  MLS

   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides group
   authenticated key exchange [MLS-ARCH] [MLS-PROTO].  In principle, it
   could be used to instantiate the sender key scheme above, but it can
   also be used more efficiently directly.

   MLS creates a linear sequence of keys, each of which is shared among
   the members of a group at a given point in time.  When a member joins
   or leaves the group, a new key is produced that is known only to the
   augmented or reduced group.  Each step in the lifetime of the group
   is known as an "epoch", and each member of the group is assigned an
   "index" that is constant for the time they are in the group.

   To generate keys and nonces for SFrame, we use the MLS exporter
   function to generate a base_key value for each MLS epoch.  Each
   member of the group is assigned a set of KID values, so that each
   member has a unique sframe_key and sframe_salt that it uses to
   encrypt with.  Senders may choose any KID value within their assigned
   set of KID values, e.g., to allow a single sender to send multiple
   uncoordinated outbound media streams.

   base_key = MLS-Exporter("SFrame 1.0 Base Key", "", AEAD.Nk)

   For compactness, we do not send the whole epoch number.  Instead, we
   send only its low-order E bits, where E is a value set by the
   application.  E effectively defines a re-ordering window, since no
   more than 2^E epochs can be active at a given time.  Receivers MUST
   be prepared for the epoch counter to roll over, removing an old epoch
   when a new epoch with the same E lower bits is introduced.

   Let S be the number of bits required to encode a member index in the
   group, i.e., the smallest value such that group_size <= (1 << S).
   The sender index is encoded in the S bits above the epoch.  The
   remaining 64 - S - E bits of the KID value are a context value chosen
   by the sender (context value 0 will produce the shortest encoded
   KID).

   KID = (context << (S + E)) + (sender_index << E) + (epoch % (1 << E))

     64-S-E bits   S bits   E bits
    <-----------> <------> <------>
   +-------------+--------+-------+
   | Context ID  | Index  | Epoch |
   +-------------+--------+-------+

               Figure 7: Structure of a KID for an MLS Sender

   Once an SFrame stack has been provisioned with the

6.  Media Considerations

6.1.  Selective Forwarding Units

   Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) (e.g., those described in
   Section 3.7 of [RFC7667]) receive the media streams from each
   participant and select which ones should be forwarded to each of the
   other participants.  There are several approaches for stream
   selection, but in general, the SFU needs to access metadata
   associated to each frame and modify the RTP information of the
   incoming packets when they are transmitted to the received
   participants.

   This section describes how this normal SFU modes of operation
   interact with the E2EE provided by SFrame.

6.1.1.  LastN and RTP stream reuse

   The SFU may choose to send only a certain number of streams based on
   the voice activity of the participants.  To avoid the overhead
   involved in establishing new transport streams, the SFU may decide to
   reuse previously existing streams or even pre-allocate a predefined
   number of streams and choose in each moment in time which participant
   media will be sent through it.

   This means that in the same transport-level stream (e.g., an RTP
   stream defined by either SSRC or MID) may carry media from different
   streams of different participants.  As different keys are used by
   each participant for encoding their media, the receiver will be able
   to verify which is the sender of the media coming within the RTP
   stream at any given point in time, preventing the SFU trying to
   impersonate any of the participants with another participant's media.

   Note that in order to prevent impersonation by a malicious
   participant (not the SFU), a mechanism based on digital signature
   would be required.  SFrame does not protect against such attacks.

6.1.2.  Simulcast

   When using simulcast, the same input image will produce N different
   encoded frames (one per simulcast layer) which would be processed
   independently by the frame encryptor and assigned an unique counter
   for each.

6.1.3.  SVC

   In both temporal and spatial scalability, the SFU may choose to drop
   layers in order to match a certain bitrate or forward specific media
   sizes or frames per second.  In order to support the SFU selectively
   removing layers, the sender MUST encapsulate each layer in a
   different SFrame ciphertext.

6.2.  Video Key Frames

   Forward Security and Post-Compromise Security require that the E2EE
   keys (base keys) are updated any time a participant joins or leaves
   the call.

   The key exchange happens asynchronously and on a different path than
   the SFU signaling and media.  So it may happen that when a new
   participant joins the call and the SFU side requests a key frame, the
   sender generates the E2EE frame with a key not known by the receiver,
   so it will be discarded.  When the sender updates his sending key
   with the new key, it will send it in a non-key frame, so the receiver
   will be able to decrypt it, but not decode it.

   The new Receiver will then re-request a key frame, but due to sender
   and SFU policies, that new key frame could take some time to be
   generated.

   If the sender sends a key frame after the new E2EE key is in use, the
   time required for the new participant to display the video is
   minimized.

   Note that this issue does not arise for media streams that do not
   have dependencies among frames, e.g., audio streams.  In these
   streams, each frame is independently decodeable, so there is never a
   need to process two frames together which might be on two sides of a
   key rotation.

6.3.  Partial Decoding

   Some codecs support partial decoding, where individual packets can be
   decoded without waiting for the full frame to arrive.  When SFrame is
   applied per-frame, this won't be possible because the decoder cannot
   access data until an entire frame has arrived and has been decrypted.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  No Header Confidentiality

   SFrame provides integrity protection to the SFrame Header (the key ID
   and counter values), but does not provide confidentiality protection.
   Parties that can observe the SFrame header may learn, for example,
   which parties are sending SFrame payloads (from KID values) and at
   what rates (from CTR values).  In cases where SFrame is used for end-
   to-end security on top of hop-by-hop protections (e.g., running over
   SRTP as described in Appendix C.5), the hop-by-hop security
   mechanisms provide confidentiality protection of the SFrame header
   between hops.

7.2.  No Per-Sender Authentication

   SFrame does not provide per-sender authentication of media data.  Any
   sender in a session can send media that will be associated with any
   other sender.  This is because SFrame uses symmetric encryption to
   protect media data, so that any receiver also has the keys required
   to encrypt packets for the sender.

7.3.  Key Management

   Key exchange mechanism is out of scope of this document, however
   every client SHOULD change their keys when new clients joins or
   leaves the call for forward secrecy and post compromise security.

7.4.  Replay

   The handling of replay is out of the scope of this document.
   However, senders MUST reject requests to encrypt multiple times with
   the same key and nonce, since several AEAD algorithms fail badly in
   such cases (see, e.g., Section 5.1.1 of [RFC5116]).

7.5.  Risks due to Short Tags

   The SFrame ciphersuites based on AES-CTR allow for the use of short
   authentication tags, which bring a higher risk that an attacker will
   be able to cause an SFrame receiver to accept an SFrame ciphertext of
   the attacker's choosing.

   Assuming that the authentication properties of the ciphersuite are
   robust, the only attack that an attacker can mount is an attempt to
   find an acceptable (ciphertext, tag) combination through brute force.
   Such a brute-force attack will have an expected sucess rate of the
   following form:

   attacker_success_rate = attempts_per_second / 2^(8*Nt)

   For example, a gigabit ethernet connection is able to transmit
   roughly 2^20 packets per second.  If an attacker saturated such a
   link with guesses against a 32-bit authentication tag (Nt=4), then
   the attacker would succeed on average roughly once every 2^12
   seconds, or about once an hour.

   In a typical SFrame usage in a real-time media application, there are
   a few approaches to mitigating this risk:

   *  Receivers only accept SFrame ciphertexts over HBH-secure channels
      (e.g., SRTP security associations or QUIC connections).  If this
      is the case, only an entity that is part of such a channel can
      mount the above attack.

   *  The expected packet rate for a media stream is very predictable
      (and typically far lower than the above example).  On the one
      hand, attacks at this rate will succeed even less often than the
      high-rate attack described above.  On the other hand, the
      application may use an elevated packet arrival rate as a signal of
      a brute-force attack.  This latter approach is common in other
      settings, e.g., mitigating brute-force attacks on passwords.

   *  Media applications typically do not provide feedback to media
      senders as to which media packets failed to decrypt.  When media
      quality feedback mechanisms are used, decryption failures will
      typically appear as packet losses, but only at an aggregate level.

   *  Anti-replay mechanisms (see Section 7.4) prevent the attacker from
      re-using valid ciphertexts (either observed or guessed by the
      attacker).  A receiver applying anti-replay controls will only
      accept one valid plaintext per CTR value.  Since the CTR value is
      covered by SFrame authentication, an attacker has to do a fresh
      search for a valid tag for every forged ciphertext, even if the
      encrypted content is unchanged.  In other words, when the above
      brute force attack succeeds, it only allows the attacker to send a
      single SFrame ciphertext; the ciphertext cannot be reused because
      either it will have the same CTR value and be discarded as a
      replay, or else it will have a different CTR value its tag will no
      longer be valid.

   Nonetheless, without these mitigations, an application that makes use
   of short tags will be at heightened risk of forgery attacks.  In many
   cases, it is simpler to use full-size tags and tolerate slightly
   higher bandwidth usage rather than add the additional defenses
   necessary to safely use short tags.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the creation of the following new IANA
   registry:

   *  SFrame Cipher Suites (Section 8.1)

   This registry should be under a heading of "SFrame", and assignments
   are made via the Specification Required policy [RFC8126].

   RFC EDITOR: Please replace XXXX throughout with the RFC number
   assigned to this document

8.1.  SFrame Cipher Suites

   This registry lists identifiers for SFrame cipher suites, as defined
   in Section 4.5.  The cipher suite field is two bytes wide, so the
   valid cipher suites are in the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.

   Template:

   *  Value: The numeric value of the cipher suite

   *  Name: The name of the cipher suite

   *  Reference: The document where this cipher suite is defined

9.  Application Responsibilities

   To use SFrame, an application needs to define the inputs to the
   SFrame encryption and decryption operations, and how SFrame
   ciphertexts are delivered from sender to receiver (including any
   fragmentation and reassembly).  In this section, we lay out
   additional requirements that an integration must meet in order for
   SFrame to operate securely.

   In general, an application using SFrame is responsible for
   configuring SFrame.  The application must first define when SFrame is
   applied at all.  When SFrame is applied, the application must define
   which cipher suite is to be used.  If new versions of SFrame are
   defined in the future, it will be up to the application to determine
   which version should be used.

   This division of responsibilities is similar to the way other media
   parameters (e.g., codecs) are typically handled in media
   applications, in the sense that they are set up in some signaling
   protocol, and then not described in the media.  Applications might
   find it useful to extend the protocols used for negotiating other
   media parameters (e.g., SDP [RFC4566]) to also negotiate parameters
   for SFrame.

9.1.  Header Value Uniqueness

   Applications MUST ensure that each (base_key, KID, CTR) combination
   is used for at most one SFrame encryption operation.  This ensures
   that the (key, nonce) pairs used by the underlying AEAD algorithm are
   never reused.  Typically this is done by assigning each sender a KID
   or set of KIDs, then having each sender use the CTR field as a
   monotonic counter, incrementing for each plaintext that is encrypted.
   In addition to its simplicity, this scheme minimizes overhead by
   keeping CTR values as small as possible.

9.2.  Key Management Framework

   It is up to the application to provision SFrame with a mapping of KID
   values to base_key values and the resulting keys and salts.  More
   importantly, the application specifies which KID values are used for
   which purposes (e.g., by which senders).  An application's KID
   assignment strategy MUST be structured to assure the non-reuse
   properties discussed in Section 9.1.

   It is also up to the application to define a rotation schedule for
   keys.  For example, one application might have an ephemeral group for
   every call and keep rotating keys when end points join or leave the
   call, while another application could have a persistent group that
   can be used for multiple calls and simply derives ephemeral symmetric
   keys for a specific call.

   It should be noted that KID values are not encrypted by SFrame, and
   are thus visible to any application-layer intermediaries that might
   handle an SFrame ciphertext.  If there are application semantics
   included in KID values, then this information would be exposed to
   intermediaries.  For example, in the scheme of Section 5.1, the
   number of ratchet steps per sender is exposed, and in the scheme of
   Section 5.2, the number of epochs and the MLS sender ID of the SFrame
   sender are exposed.

9.3.  Anti-Replay

   It is the responsibility of the application to handle anti-replay.
   Replay by network attackers is assumed to be prevented by network-
   layer facilities (e.g., TLS, SRTP).  As mentioned in Section 7.4,
   senders MUST reject requests to encrypt multiple times with the same
   key and nonce.

   It is not mandatory to implement anti-replay on the receiver side.
   Receivers MAY apply time or counter based anti-replay mitigations.
   For example, Section 3.3.2 of [RFC3711] specifies a counter-based
   anti-replay mitigation, which could be adapted to use with SFrame,
   using the CTR field as the counter.

9.4.  Metadata

   The metadata input to SFrame operations is pure application-specified
   data.  As such, it is up to the application to define what
   information should go in the metadata input and ensure that it is
   provided to the encryption and decryption functions at the
   appropriate points.  A receiver MUST NOT use SFrame-authenticated
   metadata until after the SFrame decrypt function has authenticated
   it, unless the purpose of such usage is to prepare an SFrame
   ciphertext for SFrame decryption.  Essentially, metadata may be used
   "upstream of SFrame" in a processing pipeline, but only to prepare
   for SFrame decryption.

   For example, consider an application where SFrame is used to encrypt
   audio frames that are sent over SRTP, with some application data
   included in the RTP header extension.  Suppose the application also
   includes this application data in the SFrame metadata, so that the
   SFU is allowed to read, but not modify the application data.  A
   receiver can use the application data in the RTP header extension as
   part of the standard SRTP decryption process, since this is required
   to recover the SFrame ciphertext carried in the SRTP payload.
   However, the receiver MUST NOT use the application data for other
   purposes before SFrame decryption has authenticated the application
   data.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to specially thank Dr. Alex Gouaillard as one of the
   early contributors to the document.  His passion and energy were key
   to the design and development of SFrame.

Appendix B.  Example API

   *This section is not normative.*

   This section describes a notional API that an SFrame implementation
   might expose.  The core concept is an "SFrame context", within which
   KID values are meaningful.  In the key management scheme described in
   Section 5.1, each sender has a different context; in the scheme
   described in Section 5.2, all senders share the same context.

   An SFrame context stores mappings from KID values to "key contexts",
   which are different depending on whether the KID is to be used for
   sending or receiving (an SFrame key should never be used for both
   operations).  A key context tracks the key and salt associated to the
   KID, and the current CTR value.  A key context to be used for sending
   also tracks the next CTR value to be used.

   The primary operations on an SFrame context are as follows:

   *  *Create an SFrame context:* The context is initialized with a
      ciphersuite and no KID mappings.

   *  *Adding a key for sending:* The key and salt are derived from the
      base key, and used to initialize a send context, together with a
      zero counter value.

   *  *Adding a key for receiving:* The key and salt are derived from
      the base key, and used to initialize a send context.

   *  *Encrypt a plaintext:* Encrypt a given plaintext using the key for
      a given KID, including the specified metadata.

   *  *Decrypt an SFrame ciphertext:* Decrypt an SFrame ciphertext with
      the KID and CTR values specified in the SFrame Header, and the
      provided metadata.

   Figure 9 shows an example of the types of structures and methods that
   could be used to create an SFrame API in Rust.

   type KeyId = u64;
   type Counter = u64;
   type CipherSuite = u16;

   struct SendKeyContext {
     key: Vec<u8>,
     salt: Vec<u8>,
     next_counter: Counter,
   }

   struct RecvKeyContext {
     key: Vec<u8>,

Appendix C.  Overhead Analysis

   Any use of SFrame will impose overhead in terms of the amount of
   bandwidth necessary to transmit a given media stream.  Exactly how
   much overhead will be added depends on several factors:

   *  How many senders are involved in a conference (length of KID)

   *  How long the conference has been going on (length of CTR)

   *  The cipher suite in use (length of authentication tag)

   *  Whether SFrame is used to encrypt packets, whole frames, or some
      other unit

   Overall, the overhead rate in kilobits per second can be estimated
   as:

   OverheadKbps = (1 + |CTR| + |KID| + |TAG|) * 8 * CTPerSecond / 1024

   Here the constant value 1 reflects the fixed SFrame header; |CTR|
   and |KID| reflect the lengths of those fields; |TAG| reflects the
   cipher overhead; and CTPerSecond reflects the number of SFrame
   ciphertexts sent per second (e.g., packets or frames per second).

   In the remainder of this secton, we compute overhead estimates for a
   collection of common scenarios.

C.1.  Assumptions

   In the below calculations, we make conservative assumptions about
   SFrame overhead, so that the overhead amounts we compute here are
   likely to be an upper bound on those seen in practice.

           | Key ID (KID) |     2 | >255 senders; or MLS epoch |
           |              |       | (E=4) and >16 senders      |
           +--------------+-------+----------------------------+
           | Counter      |     3 | More than 24 hours of      |
           | (CTR)        |       | media in common cases      |

           | Cipher       |    16 | Full GCM tag (longest      |
           | overhead     |       | defined here)              |
           +--------------+-------+----------------------------+

                                  Table 3

   In total, then, we assume that each SFrame encryption will add 22
   bytes of overhead.

   We consider two scenarios, applying SFrame per-frame and per-packet.
   In each scenario, we compute the SFrame overhead in absolute terms
   (Kbps) and as a percentage of the base bandwidth.

C.2.  Audio

   In audio streams, there is typically a one-to-one relationship
   between frames and packets, so the overhead is the same whether one
   uses SFrame at a per-packet or per-frame level.

   The below table considers three scenarios, based on recommended
   configurations of the Opus codec [RFC6716]:

   *  Narrow-band speech: 120ms packets, 8Kbps

   *  Full-band speech: 20ms packets, 32Kbps

   *  Full-band stereo music: 10ms packets, 128Kbps

     +===============+=====+===========+===============+============+

     | 120ms packets |     |           |               |            |

     | 20ms packets  |     |           |               |            |
     +---------------+-----+-----------+---------------+------------+
     | FB stereo,    | 100 |    128    |      17.2     |   13.4%    |
     | 10ms packets  |     |           |               |            |
     +---------------+-----+-----------+---------------+------------+

                Table 4: SFrame overhead for audio streams

C.3.  Video

   Video frames can be larger than an MTU and thus are commonly split
   across multiple frames.  Table 5 and Table 6 show the estimated
   overhead of encrypting a video stream, where SFrame is applied per-
   frame and per-packet, respectively.  The choices of resolution,
   frames per second, and bandwidth are chosen to roughly reflect the
   capabilities of modern video codecs across a range from very low to
   very high quality.

     Table 6: SFrame overhead for a video stream encrypted per-packet

   In the per-frame case, the SFrame percentage overhead approaches zero
   as the quality of the video goes up, since bandwidth is driven more
   by picture size than frame rate.  In the per-packet case, the SFrame
   percentage overhead approaches the ratio between the SFrame overhead
   per packet and the MTU (here 22 bytes of SFrame overhead divided by
   an assumed 1200-byte MTU, or about 1.8%).

C.4.  Conferences

   Real conferences usually involve several audio and video streams.
   The overhead of SFrame in such a conference is the aggregate of the
   overhead over all the individual streams.  Thus, while SFrame incurs
   a large percentage overhead on an audio stream, if the conference
   also involves a video stream, then the audio overhead is likely
   negligible relative to the overall bandwidth of the conference.

   For example, Table 7 shows the overhead estimates for a two person
   conference where one person is sending low-quality media and the
   other sending high-quality.  (And we assume that SFrame is applied
   per-frame.)  The video streams dominate the bandwidth at the SFU, so
   the total bandwidth overhead is only around 1%.

           Table 7: SFrame overhead for a two-person conference

C.5.  SFrame over RTP

   SFrame is a generic encapsulation format, but many of the
   applications in which it is likely to be integrated are based on RTP.
   This section discusses how an integration between SFrame and RTP
   could be done, and some of the challenges that would need to be
   overcome.

   As discussed in Section 4.1, there are two natural patterns for
   integrating SFrame into an application: applying SFrame per-frame or
   per-packet.  In RTP-based applications, applying SFrame per-packet
   means that the payload of each RTP packet will be an SFrame
   ciphertext, starting with an SFrame Header, as shown in Figure 10.
   Applying SFrame per-frame means that different RTP payloads will have
   different formats: The first payload of a frame will contain the
   SFrame headers, and subsequent payloads will contain further chunks
   of the ciphertext, as shown in Figure 11.

   In order for these media payloads to be properly interpreted by
   receivers, receivers will need to be configured to know which of the
   above schemes the sender has applied to a given sequence of RTP
   packets.  SFrame does not provide a mechanism for distributing this
   configuration information.  In applications that use SDP for
   negotiating RTP media streams [RFC4566], an appropriate extension to
   SDP could provide this function.

   Applying SFrame per-frame also requires that packetization and
   depacketization be done in a generic manner that does not depend on
   the media content of the packets, since the content being packetized
   / depacketized will be opaque ciphertext (except for the SFrame
   header).  In order for such a generic packetization scheme to work
   interoperably one would have to be defined, e.g., as proposed in
   [I-D.codec-agnostic-rtp-payload-format].

Appendix D.  Test Vectors

   This section provides a set of test vectors that implementations can
   use to verify that they correctly implement SFrame encryption and
   decryption.  In addition to test vectors for the overall process of
   SFrame encryption/decryption, we also provide test vectors for header
   encoding/decoding, and for AEAD encryption/decryption using the AES-
   CTR construction defined in Section 4.5.1.

   All values are either numeric or byte strings.  Numeric values are
   represented as hex values, prefixed with 0x.  Byte strings are
   represented in hex encoding.

   Line breaks and whitespace within values are inserted to conform to
   the width requirements of the RFC format.  They should be removed
   before use.

   These test vectors are also available in JSON format at
   [TestVectors].  In the JSON test vectors, numeric values are JSON
   numbers and byte string values are JSON strings containing the hex
   encoding of the byte strings.

D.1.  Header encoding/decoding

   For each case, we provide:

   *  kid: A KID value

   *  ctr: A CTR value

   *  header: An encoded SFrame header

   An implementation should verify that:

   *  Encoding a header with the KID and CTR results in the provided
      header value

   *  Decoding the provided header value results in the provided KID and
      CTR values

D.2.  AEAD encryption/decryption using AES-CTR and HMAC

   For each case, we provide:

   *  cipher_suite: The index of the cipher suite in use (see
      Section 8.1)

   *  key: The key input to encryption/decryption

   *  enc_key: The encryption subkey produced by the derive_subkeys()
      algorithm

   *  auth_key: The encryption subkey produced by the derive_subkeys()
      algorithm

   *  nonce: The nonce input to encryption/decryption

   *  aad: The aad input to encryption/decryption

   *  pt: The plaintext

   *  ct: The ciphertext

   An implementation should verify that the following are true, where
   AEAD.Encrypt and AEAD.Decrypt are as defined in Section 4.5.1:

   *  AEAD.Encrypt(key, nonce, aad, pt) == ct

   *  AEAD.Decrypt(key, nonce, aad, ct) == pt

   The other values in the test vector are intermediate values provided
   to facilitate debugging of test failures.

D.3.  SFrame encryption/decryption

   For each case, we provide:

   *  cipher_suite: The index of the cipher suite in use (see
      Section 8.1)

   *  kid: A KID value

   *  ctr: A CTR value

   *  base_key: The base_key input to the derive_key_salt algorithm

   *  sframe_key_label: The label used to derive sframe_key in the
      derive_key_salt algorithm

   *  sframe_salt_label: The label used to derive sframe_salt in the
      derive_key_salt algorithm

   *  sframe_secret: The sframe_secret variable in the derive_key_salt
      algorithm

   *  sframe_key: The sframe_key value produced by the derive_key_salt
      algorithm

   *  sframe_salt: The sframe_salt value produced by the derive_key_salt
      algorithm

   *  metadata: The metadata input to the SFrame encrypt algorithm

   *  pt: The plaintext

   *  ct: The SFrame ciphertext

   An implementation should verify that the following are true, where
   encrypt and decrypt are as defined in Section 4.4, using an SFrame
   context initialized with base_key assigned to kid:

   *  encrypt(ctr, kid, metadata, plaintext) == ct

   *  decrypt(metadata, ct) == pt

   The other values in the test vector are intermediate values provided
   to facilitate debugging of test failures.
